# Dictionaries and lists share the following characteristics:

#    - Both are mutable.
#    - Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.
#    - Both can be nested. A list can contain another list. 
#       A dictionary can contain another dictionary. 
#       A dictionary can also contain a list, and vice versa.

# Dictionaries differ from lists primarily in how elements 
#   are accessed:
#    - List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.
#    - Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.

# Defining Dictionaries

# name = {
#			<key> : <value> ,
#			<key> : <value>
#			...
#        }
