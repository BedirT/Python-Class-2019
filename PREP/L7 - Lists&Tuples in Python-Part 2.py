# Prepending or Appending Items to a List


# You can't append one item, you have to append a list
# ls += 20 # Wrong

# Methods That Modify a List
# append
# ls.append(<obj>)


# We also can append a list

# extend
# ls.extend(<obj>)


# insert
# ls.insert(<index>, <obj>)


# remove


# pop(index=-1)


# Lists are dynamic.


# Python Tuples


# Unlike lists tuples are immutable
# t[0] = 'd'


# Tuple Assignment, Packing, and Unpacking
