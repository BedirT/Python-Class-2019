# Python Class 2019

This repository includes the materials we used in class to learn python basics. It is a 12 week course, including the project at the end. I will be adding all the materials after every class.

### Structure

#### Prep
This section includes the raw materials I prepared before class, it is meant to be used as for same purpose, or if anyone is interested only in major titles I planned to teach in that class.

#### After Class
This section is for students and parets to see the notes we finally have when the section or class ends. The students are already required to take notes -should look almost same with mine- you can compare and check the missing parts.

### Naming Convention
File names are in format; 
L (Lecture) + Class number + Section + The topic name
***Example:** L3.2 - Operators and Expressions in Python.py*
